# Image Placement Guide

Save your 8 shared images into the `images` folder. You can reuse the same image for multiple slots—just copy it and rename.

| Filename | Use This Image | Where It Appears |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| `hero.jpg` | White jet on tarmac at golden hour (sunrise/sunset), dramatic sky | Hero section |
| `what-we-do.jpg` | White jet with blue stripe in bright hangar, natural light | What We Do background |
| `how-it-works.jpg` | Silver jet head-on on runway, low angle | How It Works (blurred bg) |
| `difference-typical.jpg` | White jet at night, door open, stairs extended | "Typical empty-leg" column |
| `difference-aurelian.jpg` | White jet with blue stripe in hangar, polished | "Aurelian Jets" column |
| `charter.jpg` | Silver/chrome jet on wet tarmac at sunset | Charter Services |
| `empty-leg.jpg` | Same as difference-typical (night jet, door open) | Empty-Leg Flights |
| `first-class.jpg` | Interior: champagne, wooden table, cream leather seat | First-Class Backup |
| `guaranteed.jpg` | Same as how-it-works (silver jet head-on) | Guaranteed Arrival |

**Steps:**
1. Right-click each of your 8 images (or save from chat)
2. Save to: `C:\Users\jbrea\OneDrive\Desktop\Aurelian\images\`
3. Use the exact filenames above (copy the same file for slots that share an image)
4. Formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` (change paths in code if using `.png`)

Until you add the images, the site uses Unsplash fallbacks so it still looks professional.
